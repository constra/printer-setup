The PrinterLinkDroplet allows you to quickly generate a batch script (.bat) for quick queue creation on Microsoft Windows.

This batch file generation is very experimntal. It will only preserve the queue name and the network location in the PSF. All other data in the PSF is currrenlty ignored.

This is a simple wrapper script. The script which is actually perfoms the generation of the bat file entries is located in the "/Examples/Handy Scripts/sh-output-windows-batch-code.bash"

To get started drop some PSF onto this script and then when prompted specify your output batch file.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
